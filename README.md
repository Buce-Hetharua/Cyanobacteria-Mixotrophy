These are the the scripts and two additional data fasta files “Supplementary Data 1 all-reference-sequences-UniProt.fasta” and “Supplementary Data 2 Mixothroph-Genes.fasta” used in the publication “Temperature-driven nitrogen mixotrophy shapes marine cyanobacteria’s latitudinal distribution pattern”.

RUN-DIAMOND-MIXO-metaG-90.sh, RUN-DIAMOND-MIXO-metaT-90.sh, Merging-files.txt and Count-seqs-for-both-metaG-metaT.sh are script files that used for data analysis.
